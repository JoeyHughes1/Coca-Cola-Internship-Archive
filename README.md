# Coca-Cola-Internship-Archive
During my 3 week internship with Coca-Cola, I worked with a group of 4 other individuals to come up with an idea to get more people to recycle, whether it be recycling Coca-Cola Products or anything else.
Despite some administrative difficulties with the internship itself in the first week, by the second week we had met with recycling experts and visited Envision Charlotte's innovation barn, where sustainability experts work to solve problems like this.
We heard of their recent pilot program called SmartC, where people would be given bags they could use along with a smartphone app to recycle in exchange for rewards. However, some legal difficulties arose, and the app that had been made was no longer usable, so the program was halted.
We decided that we could use my technical abilities to recreate that app as best we could and gift it to Coca-Cola to use as our idea.
Over the next just 2 weeks I had to learn to use JavaScript, learn to use React Native and Expo, and create this app in time for our final presentation to real Coca-Cola executives. The rest of the team did not know how to code, but they worked on crafting the final presentation, editing a video version of our presentation, writing deliverables, etc.
The app was at a presentable state and working by the presentation day, and the demonstration went flawlessly.

The program is written using node.js, React Native, and Expo, with CSS for stylesheets.
App.js is the main script, linked to various app pages and components in the assets folder.

To see the app in action, I have recorded a demo showcasing most of the features that were finished: https://youtu.be/oGrYqYCxIOo
